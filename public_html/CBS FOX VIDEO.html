<h1><font face="aharoni" color="white">About CBS FOX VIDEO</font></h1>
            <h2><font face="aharoni" color="white">The CBS/Fox Company, or CBS/Fox Video was a home video company formed and established in 1982, as a merger between 20th Century Fox Video, formerly Magnetic Video Corporation, and CBS Video Enterprises which sold film libraries from major American film studios and was the American licensee of BBC Video releases. These products were released in the VHS and Betamax home video formats.</font></h2>

<h2><font face="aharoni" color="white">The company was based in Farmington Hills, Michigan (home of predecessor Magnetic Video) until 1985, when it moved to Livonia, Michigan. In 1989, it moved its headquarters to New York City, where it stayed until it became Fox Video (now 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) in 1991.</font></h2>

<h2><font face="aharoni" color="white">CBS/Fox Video was founded under a 50-50 venture with 20th Century Fox in 1982 when CBS broke off a previous venture formed in 1980 with MGM. During this period, both companies continued to operate independently while maintaining their partnership. A reorganization occurred in 1990 with CBS selling products under the CBS Video name (which had been sparingly used since the 1970s) and mainstream Fox titles controlled by Fox Video and was enacted in 1991. In 1998, CBS/Fox was acquired by Fox Entertainment Group and later ceased operations in that year. Since CBS/Fox disbanded, their film rights have been brought by 20th Century Fox and CBS merged with Viacom.</font></h2>

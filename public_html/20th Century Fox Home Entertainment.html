<h1><font face="aharoni" color="orange">About 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment</font></h1>
            <h3><font face="aharoni" color="orange">20th Century Fox Home Entertainment is the home video distribution arm of the 20th Century Fox film studio. It was established in 1976 as Magnetic Video Corporation, and was also known as 20th Century Fox Video, CBS/Fox Video and FoxVideo, Inc. The company also is best known for distributing the two highest-grossing films of all time, Titanic and Avatar.</font></h3>

<h3><font face="aharoni" color="orange">CBS/Fox became Fox Video in 1991, alternating with the CBS/Fox name until 1998. It was renamed as 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 1995, alternating with the Fox Video name until 1999.</font></h3>
<h3><font face="aharoni" color="orange">They serve as a UK distributor for French film distributor, Path√© and their film library for VHS/DVD release while Warner Bros. handles theatrical distribution as of 2010. Fox also distributed Yari Film Group DVD titles in North America.</font></h3>

<h3><font face="aharoni" color="orange">They also distribute Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists DVD titles worldwide under the MGM Home Entertainment label since MGM ended their home video agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (Fox's worldwide distribution deal with MGM was due to expire in September 2011, but was renewed and extended on April 13, 2011 and will be due to expire in 2016). They also distribute titles from Relativity Media and DreamWorks Animation, as well as Largo Entertainment among others.</font></h3>

<h3><font face="aharoni" color="orange">Fox's best selling DVD titles are currently the various season box sets of The Simpsons.[2] They also once served as the U.S. distributor for television and/or movie products released by the BBC from the 1980s to the 1990s, but those U.S. distribution rights expired at the end of 1999, and were then given to Warner Home Video.</font></h3>

<h3><font face="aharoni" color="orange">In late 2006, the company began releasing its titles on Blu-ray Disc.</font></h3>
